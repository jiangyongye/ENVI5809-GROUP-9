Title:

Land use management effectiveness in mitigating catchment nutrient loads and water qualitydegradation Great Barrier Reef lagoon, QLD, Australia.

Hypothesis:

1/ Water quality variables, DIN and PIP, will have an observable relative increase in both 2017, and 2018, in comparison to 2013.

2/ Chlorophyll concentration will have an observable realtive increase at the Dingo Reef site.

3/ There will be an observable larger positive association between Burdekin River high catchment loads and Chl concentration at Dingo Reef. 


Analysis Plan:

1/ Make a line plot demonstrating the Burdekin river DIN and PIP concentrations from 2013 to 2018, for all eReef scenarios used.

2/ Make a line plot demonstrating the Dingo Reef Chl concentrations from 2013 to 2018, for all eReef scenarios used.

3/ Make a line plot demonstrating the Burdekin river DIN and PIP concentration trends from 01-02-2018 and 01-06-2018, for all eReef scenarios used

4/ Calculate the anthroprogenic load for variables PIP and DIN for both reduction and baseline simulations. 

5/ Calculate the anthroprogenic concentrations for variable Chl at the Dingo Reef sample site for both reduction and baseline simulations.

6/ Calculate mean change in Burdekin cathcment anthropogenic loads of variables PIP and DIN for both 2017 and 2018, relative to 2013 anthropogenic loads.

7/ Calculate mean change in Dingo Reef anthropogenic concentration for Chl during both 2017 and 2018, relative to 2013 anthropogenic anthroprogenic concentrations.

8/ Make a line plot demonstrating the Dingo Reef Chl concentration trends from 01-02-2018 and 01-06-2018, for all eReef scenarios used.

9/ Complete a Pearsons correlation matrix identifying the relationship between Burdekin river DIN and PIP concentrations and Dingo Reef Chl concentration for monthly mean data between 2013 and 2019. Complete this for all three scenarios. 

10/ Repeat the above utilising daily data at both locations between 01-02-2018 and 01-06-2018.
